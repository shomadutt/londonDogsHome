        <p class="slide">
          We are one of the leading re-homing centres in the UK. Every year we
          rescue, rehabilitate and re-home thousands of dogs, but we're still
          full. Dogs come to us for all sorts of reasons. People can't afford to
          keep them, their owner died, they've strayed or not been claimed. Some
          are subjected to cruelty and neglect and some are just not wanted.
        </p>

        <p class="slide">
          We are proud to be one of very few homes who take in the most
          difficult and/or critical medical cases. Other homes, the city's
          Animal Control and our neighbors look to us for help and support.
          Unfortunately we are always at the brink of our financial boundaries
          which forces us to consider scaling down our Program. This would
          restrict us to only taking in the dogs that are already adoptable and
          leaves us unable to save the ones that truly need us. We have to ask
          for your assistance to save these truly helpless and homeless dogs.
          Whether it is illness or injury they suffer from, with your generosity
          we can help heal them and give them the second chance they deserve.
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
          With your generous donations, hundreds of critically injured animals
          who would otherwise not be given a chance could be saved and given a
          second chance at life. So many of our animals have benefited from our
          Critical Care Fund, many of whom would never have been able to regain
          their quality of life and a chance to find their forever homes. When a
          critical need is identified for one of our animals, we make an urgent
          plea for help through our website and email messages to our
          supporters. Unfortunately, many medical treatments and required
          follow-up appointments exceed the estimated costs. For this reason, it
          is always necessary to have reserve funds available whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p class="slide">
          Once rescued we may discover that an animal has extensive medical
          needs that can be addressed by quality medical intervention. Many
          times, the animal will require surgery for either a pre-existing
          medical condition or physical trauma previously sustained i.e. by
          having been hit by a car. We cannot do this alone. We need your help.
          Please consider a donation to our Home today.
